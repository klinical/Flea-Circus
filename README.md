# Flea-Circus

My solution for the INFO-1521 class at Metropolitan Community College, Omaha.

A 30x30 grid is created, with one 'flea' allocated to each grid square. The user is prompted to enter a number of bell rings to be completed, each bell ring corresponding to one square of movement for each flea. The fleas will move in 1 of 4 directions - up, down, left & right. After all movements are completed, the final grid is displayed, as well as some statistics about the positions of the fleas.
